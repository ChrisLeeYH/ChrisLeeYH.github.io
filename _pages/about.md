I'm a junior student from the School of International Studies(SIS)/School of Philosophy, [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). My research interest lies broadly in Computational Political Science and Computational Communication. Recently I have been drawn by the knowledge of political misinformation on social media. Here is a list of topics I am actively thinking about/working on: 
- **The Properties of Political Misinformation Online**: I am deeply engaged in exploring the properties of political misinformation on social media, corresponding to election topics. I believe that, understanding the properties of political misinformation is crucial for enabling governments/society to detect misinformation and continually build a better platform for expressing public opinion.

- **Public Opinion and Ideologies on Social Media**: Intrigued by the inner mechanisms of the formation of public opinion (e.g. polarization, spiral of silence), I aspire to uncover and examine the unique process discussed by different public opinion theories by large empirical data and social experiments on social media. This investigation not only promises to inform the law of public opinion formation but also offers intriguing parallels to understanding censorship and manipulation on social media by governments in some special countries/platforms.

- **Human-Computer Interaction Methodologies for Social Science Research**: Another facet of my research curiosity lies in examining the interfaces between computer/artificial intelligence and human researchers for social science (e.g. political science). I am particularly captivated by the concept of a highly tailored AI research assistant capable of involving in research with a researcher's individual experiences and interests, thereby developing personalized interaction.

Through these pursuits, I strive to contribute to the forefront of political communication and computational methodologies. My long-term research goal is to build a self-contained theory grounded by large data and experiments to explain the features of political information and public opinion in the digital age, interacting with previous theories, and ultimately pushing the boundaries of knowledge that help people understand public opinion and information on social media.
