## Sports ##
- Basketball has been a part of my life for more than 12 years. Currently, I play as a point guard on my school team, where I particularly enjoy the role of organizing the offense and creating opportunities for my teammates. In the spring of 2023, our team proudly won the championship in the basketball competition at Renmin University of China, which is an achievement that still stands out as one of my most memorable sporting experiences. Beyond the competition, basketball has shaped how I approach teamwork, leadership, and perseverance both on and off the court.

- In addition to basketball, I also enjoy running. Middle-distance races are especially appealing to me, and I am able to complete the 800 m in under 2 minutes 20 seconds. Running has become both a way to challenge my endurance and a practice that helps me stay disciplined and focused.



## Entertainment ##

- I have a deep appreciation for the performing arts, especially musicals. Productions like Hamilton and Les Misérables inspire me with their blend of storytelling, music, and stagecraft, and they remind me of the power of art to connect people across cultures and generations.

- Music has been a personal passion since childhood. I studied the flute for over ten years and earned the Amateur Level 10 Certificate from the Central Conservatory of Music in China. This training not only gave me technical skill but also taught me creativity and a lifelong appreciation for artistic expression.
